# Stateful-Agent

A sophisticated agent system that maintains state and context through the combination of persistent entity storage (SQLite) and vector-based memory (ChromaDB).

## Overview

Stateful-Agent is designed to provide a robust solution for maintaining conversational context and user information across interactions. It leverages two different types of databases:

- **SQLite**: For structured data storage and retrieval of user information and persistent state
- **ChromaDB**: For vector-based storage enabling semantic search and contextual memory

## Features

- 🔄 Persistent user data storage with SQLite
- 🧠 Semantic memory capabilities using ChromaDB vector database
- 🔍 Case-insensitive user handling
- 🚫 Duplicate prevention for user entries
- ✅ Structured data validation and management
- 📄 PDF document processing and analysis
- 🔗 Integration with various external tools (GitHub, Slack, Google)
- 📚 Research lab collections management
- 📖 Google Scholar paper tracking and crawling
- 🔬 Paper recommendation based on research interests
- 📝 Contextual paper summarization with related research

## New Features: Paper Recommendation and Summary

The agent now supports robust academic paper management and recommendation features:

### Research Lab Management

- Create lab collections with persistent information (name, institution, leader, members, etc.)
- Add lab members with their Google Scholar profiles
- Track papers published by lab members

### Paper Collection and Recommendation

- Automatically crawl Google Scholar pages of lab members to collect their arXiv papers
- Check for new papers by lab members during conversations
- Store PDF documents in the data directory with proper organization
- Recommend relevant papers from arXiv based on the lab's research interests and time period
- Save recommended papers and their embeddings to prevent duplication

### Paper Summarization

- Generate comprehensive paper summaries for specific lab member papers
- Utilize complete paper content for more thorough and accurate summaries of target papers
- Extract semantic sections (introduction, conclusion) from LaTeX source files of related papers when available
- Include contextual information from related papers in the lab collection
- Draw insights from both lab papers and recommended papers
- Provide academic-style summaries with key findings, methodologies, and relationships to existing research

## LinkedIn Integration

### Setting Up LinkedIn API Access

1. Create a LinkedIn Developer Application:
   - Go to [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/)
   - Create a new app providing:
     - App Name
     - Application logo
     - LinkedIn company page (required, cannot be a profile page)
   - Accept terms and conditions

2. Configure Application Permissions:
   - Under Products, request access for:
     - "Share on LinkedIn" (adds w_member_social scope)
     - "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" (adds openid and email scopes)

3. Generate Access Token:
   For personal use (recommended):
   - Go to [LinkedIn OAuth2 tools](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth)
   - Generate a token with scopes: `w_member_social openid email profile'
   - Note: Access tokens are valid for 60 days

4. Get User ID:
   ```bash
   curl --location 'https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
   ```
   Save the returned user ID.

### Environment Configuration

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
LINKEDIN_USER_ID=your_user_id
LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
```

#### Features:
- Supports text posts with formatting and emojis
- Configurable visibility (PUBLIC or CONNECTIONS)
- Automatic error handling and validation
- Environment-based configuration

#### Agent Integration:
The LinkedIn publisher is available as an agent tool and can be used with the following parameters:
- `commentary`: The content of the post
- `visibility`: Post visibility setting ("PUBLIC" or "CONNECTIONS")

### Important Notes:
- LinkedIn access tokens expire after 60 days

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- OpenAI API key (gpt-4o model for paper summarization and embeddings)
- Internet connection for accessing Google Scholar and arXiv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsd9696/stateful-agent.git
cd stateful-agent
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
cd stateful_agent
```

- .env

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```


## Configuration

1. Create necessary configuration files in the `stateful_agent` directory:

### .env

```env
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY

CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY=./chroma_langchain_db
SQLITE_DB_PATH=./sqlite_langchain_db.db
DEFAULT_DATA_DIR=./data
```

## Usage

1. Prepare the environment:

```bash
